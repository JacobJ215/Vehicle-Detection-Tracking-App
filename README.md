## Object Detection and Tracking Overview

### YOLO-NAS with SORT Tracking
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system. YOLO-NAS (Neural Architecture Search) is a YOLO variant that is optimized for detecting a wide range of objects.
- SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) is a simple, yet effective, online multiple object tracking algorithm. It associates detections in consecutive frames to track objects.

### YOLOv8 with ByteTrack and Supervision
- YOLOv8 is another variant of YOLO, known for its high accuracy and speed in object detection.
- ByteTrack is a state-of-the-art online multi-object tracking algorithm that employs motion and appearance cues to track objects effectively.
- Supervision is a toolkit for YOLO-based object detection models.

## YOLO-NAS Overview

- YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection model developed by Ultralytics, known for its high accuracy and developer-friendly features.
- It introduces significant architectural improvements over its predecessors and is actively supported by the community.

### Main Features of YOLOv8
- Utilizes an anchor-free detection system for more accurate predictions.
- Incorporates new convolutional blocks for improved performance.
- Implements Mosaic Augmentation for enhanced training.


## ByteTrack and SORT Tracking
- ByteTrack and SORT are advanced online multi-object tracking algorithms that complement YOLO-based object detection models.
- ByteTrack leverages motion and appearance cues for effective object tracking.
- SORT associates detections in consecutive frames to create object tracks.
